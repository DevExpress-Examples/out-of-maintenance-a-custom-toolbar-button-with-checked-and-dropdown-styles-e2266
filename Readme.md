The <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/clsDevExpressXtraBarsBarButtonItemtopic">BarButtonItem</a> provides a <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraBarsBarButtonItem_ButtonStyletopic">ButtonStyle</a> property. It allows you to make your button <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument348">act like a check box</a> or implement <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument349">a down arrow that opens a dropdown control</a>, for it. However, there is no option to activate the Check and DropDown button styles simultaneously.
